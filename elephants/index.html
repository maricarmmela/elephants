        <h1>How we rescue them?</h1>
        <h2>
            Rescuing elephants in Africa is a critical mission driven by the urgency to protect these iconic creatures from various threats. Orphaned elephants, often victims of poaching or human-wildlife conflict, require swift intervention and specialized care. Dedicated conservationists and wildlife authorities work tirelessly to rescue and rehabilitate these vulnerable calves, providing essential medical attention and nurturing support. Rehabilitation centers serve as sanctuaries where rescued elephants undergo a comprehensive recovery process, regaining physical and emotional health while learning vital survival skills. Efforts to mitigate human-elephant conflicts are also crucial, promoting coexistence and reducing confrontations. Reintroduction programs aim to reintegrate rehabilitated elephants into their natural habitats, contributing to ecosystem balance. Continued monitoring and support are essential for the success of these programs, ensuring the well-being and adaptation of reintroduced elephants. Overall, these efforts are vital for the long-term survival of elephants in Africa and the preservation of biodiversity.</h2>
